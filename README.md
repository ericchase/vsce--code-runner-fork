## Code Runner Fork

Original code base is under `src/original-repo`. I reset the main branch history because this is no longer a fork. It is more of a wrapper, now. The old history can be found on branch `0.13.0`.

Check [README.md](./src/README.md) under the `src` folder for more information about the extension.

### Changes

Check [CHANGELOG.md](./src/CHANGELOG.md) under the `src` folder.
